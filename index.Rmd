## Abstract

I've cleaned up and began to visualize possible things I could do whilst working on this given dataset https://www.kaggle.com/rush4ratio/video-game-sales-with-ratings/

### 1. Discovery and Data Preparation

Here I've introduced, cleaned up, and summarized the data I've chosen.

### 2. Model Planning and Building

In this part, I add in console sales into my data and use that along with other variables to predict game sales.
